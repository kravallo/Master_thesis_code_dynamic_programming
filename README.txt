README

This repo documents the main code used for the master's thesis at the University of Copenhagen supervised by Thomas JÃ¸rgensen. Code is inspired by lecture material from the course "Dynamic Programming - Theory, Computation, and Empirical Applications" (see: https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%C3%98kk08207u/) and https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/ConsumptionSavingNotebooks.

Main file: Final_report_thesis.ipynb 

In the notebook file some results are precomputed, especially the 10x10 runs that generated the csv files. Because executing that cell again would take multiple hours, these cells are commented out in the notebook. However, the output from the last run should still be visible. Rerunning all cells will clear the outputs so I recommend to check the output before re-running everything.

Code files: all files ending with .py (are imported by main file)

Data files in folder: all files ending with .csv (have to be moved to same folder as .ipynb file)
