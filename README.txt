In the notebook file some results are precomputed, especially the 10x10 runs that generated the csv files. Because executing that cell again would take multiple hours, these cells are commented out. However, the output from the last run should still be visible. Rerunning all cells will clear the outputs so I recommend to check the output before re-running everything.

Code files: all files ending with .py (are imported by main file)

Data files: all files ending with .csv (do not delete, move or change)

Outputs: all images ending with .png (used in paper)
